# Å»abik Smarthome
Some of my projects based on [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/)/[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

## Humidifier
Smart evaporative humidifier in a shoe-box form factor. Made using:
- Plastic shoe container with drilled holes
- Computer fan glued on top
- Philips FY24xx/HU48xx wick filter
- ESPHome onboard common D1 Mini board

Features:
- Set desired humidity - the device regulates its fan speed automatically
- Monitors water level, alerts on low level
- Physical power button with indicator light
- Night mode (low speed), do not disturb (fans and lights off)
- Mold protection - vent the device when room humidity is high, and there is still water left in the tank

*TODO: photos, BOM, circuit design*
